->Do the lab on your own...you get a whole week to do this
->In the lab hours,do all the thinking that is required to do the lab rather than actually coding bcuz palash can help you with the thinking
->lab exam qps aren't there bcuz they were not given but expect atleast one direct question(almost without any change) from the labs that you have done
->just read the lectures for theory...almost all the people get same(not necessarily full) marks
